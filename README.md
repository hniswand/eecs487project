*EECS 487*
Hannah Niswander, Yousol Bae, Dan Lin

  

**1. Project Description**

  

This code includes a Naive-Bayes baseline model and a BERT model which are intended to be used on a contraceptive review dataset. The models included will train on a set of reviews and perform sentiment analysis, outputting an accuracy score after testing on a test set.

  

**2. How to Install and Run**

  

The Naive-Bayes model was written as a Jupyter Notebook, so it is necessary to have that installed. The BERT model was written and run using Google Colab, which should not require any installations. Ensure that you have the reviews.csv dataset downloaded as well.

  

*Naive-Bayes Model*
To run the Naive-Bayes model, download the baseline.ipynb and naive_bayes.py. The baseline.ipynb file will walk you through the steps to downloading the necessary libraries, training, and testing the model.

  

*BERT Model*
To run the BERT model, download the bertModelBase.ipynb file and upload it to Google Drive. Open the file in Google Colab, and run each cell as written in the file.
